I have an interest in mathematics and music.


### Mathematical Interests

The crux of my interests falls within the intersection between geometry and \\(\infty\\)-categories. Aside from that, I like category theory and abstract homotopy theory.
Below, I have tried to compile a list of some things I've found interesting, whether or not I know anything deep about them.

- Derived/spectral algebraic geometry.
- Condensed mathematics, and the (derived) analytic geometry one can do with it.
- Motivic homotopy theory.
- \\(\infty\\)-category theory and higher algebra.
- \\(K\\)-theory of \\(\infty\\)-categories.
- Applications of the above to
  - algebraic/arithmetic/analytic geometry,
  - number theory,
  - (stable) homotopy theory,
  - the Langlands program,
  - etc.

Of course, I also appreciate ordinary category theory and algebraic geometry. The above primarily relates the directions I want to go.
