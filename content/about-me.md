I have an interest in mathematics and music. See [writings](/writings) for a collection of my mathematical work.

## Mathematical Interests

The crux of my interests falls within the intersection between geometry and \\(\infty\\)-categories. Aside from that, I like category theory and abstract homotopy theory.
Below, I have tried to compile a list of some things I've found interesting, whether or not I know anything deep about them.

- Derived/spectral algebraic geometry.
- Condensed mathematics, and the (derived) analytic geometry one can do with it.
- Motivic homotopy theory.
- \\(\infty\\)-category theory and higher algebra.
- \\(K\\)-theory of \\(\infty\\)-categories.
- "Categorical" theories of geometry, like tt-geometry, and noncommutative algebraic geometry more broadly.
- Applications of the above to
  - algebraic/arithmetic/analytic geometry,
  - number theory,
  - (stable) homotopy theory,
  - the Langlands program,
  - etc.
- (Homotopy) type theory, for its applications in proof verification and in possibly making \\(\infty\\)-categories more approachable.

Of course, I also appreciate ordinary category theory and algebraic geometry. The above primarily relates the directions I want to go.

## Musical Interests

I make experimental rock music, and have been playing piano since 2006. See [this page](/music) for a more in-depth explanation.

## Other Interests

#### Programming
I've had an on-and-off interest in programming since I was in middle school. At some point, I chose to focus on math instead, but I still retain a basic
interest in programming and computers. One day, I will write a toy program in `rust` (actually, I want to write an actually good, native linux music player and organizer Ã  la MusicBee on Windows).
I've done a lot of python programming. I also have a small amount of experience with Haskell, from taking a course on functional programming at LTH in Lund, Sweden. It's
a neat language. I've played around a little bit with Lean in the past, but not a whole lot.

For anyone wishing to dump Windows and move to linux, I recommend CachyOS.

#### Film
I also like films. Here are some:
- *The Taste of Tea.* A really incredible film.
- *Apocalypse Now.* Used to be my favourite film before being topped by the above. I didn't like the director's cut much.
- *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.* My favourite comedy. One of the only film adaptations of a book I've seen that does justice to the source material. Terry Gilliam has also made the incredible *Brazil*, amongst other things.
- Takeshi Kitano's "art films": *Hana-bi*, *Sonatine*, *Dolls*, and *Takeshis'.*
- Hideaki Anno's films: *Love & Pop* and *Ritual.* Curiously, the latter is co-written by one of Steven Seagal's daughters.
- Akira Kurosawa's films: Of course the classics like *Seven Samurai* and *Ikiru*, but his later films are somewhat underlooked. The movies *Dreams* and *Madadayo* are both very compelling.
- Werner Herzog's films and documentaries. Too many to list. *Grizzly Man* also features music by Jim O'Rourke, one of my favourite musicians.
- Charlie Kaufman's films: *Being John Malkovich*, *Adaptation*, and *Synecdoche, New York* are all very good.
- *The Happiness of the Katakuris.* An absolutely absurd film by Takashi Miike. There is very little like it.
- *Koyaanisqatsi.* A beautifully shot collage.
- *Du levande.* A Swedish dark comedy film by Roy Andersson. Hilarious in its own way.
