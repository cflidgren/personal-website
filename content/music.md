I make experimental rock music, available on [bandcamp](https://gren.bandcamp.com "Grenly | Bandcamp"). On the bottom of this page, I have embedded all albums from my bandcamp page for ease of access,
in reverse-chronological order. There is over 20 hours of music.

I recommend *Looking Down Into a Hole* and *Landscape Impressions.*

I've played piano since 2006, when I was 6 years old. More recently, I picked up guitar around 2018. I am also able to make semi-reasonable noises on saxophone. Besides those, I've tried
playing drums, cello, violin, accordion, trombone, and sitar with varying levels of success.

I encourage anyone interested in playing with me to contact me.
