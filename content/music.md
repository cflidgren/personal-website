I make experimental rock music, available on [bandcamp](https://gren.bandcamp.com "Grenly | Bandcamp"). On the bottom of this page, I have embedded all albums from my bandcamp page for ease of access,
in reverse-chronological order. There is over 20 hours of music.

I recommend *Looking Down Into a Hole* and *Landscape Impressions.* More recently, *Music Without Motion.*

I've played piano since 2006, when I was 6 years old. More recently, I picked up guitar around 2018. I am also able to make semi-reasonable noises on saxophone. Besides those, I've tried
playing drums, cello, violin, accordion, trombone, and sitar with varying levels of success.

I encourage anyone interested in playing with me to contact me.

## Compositions
Below is a list of my *written* compositions. As of yet, only one!
1. *Untitled,* for two guitars. 2025. Score available [here](/scores/for-two-guitars.pdf).
